# GraphQL Apollo POC  

This is a proof of concept (POC) project demonstrating the creation of a GraphQL API using Apollo Server and a frontend client using Apollo Client with React.  

## ðŸš€ Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  
Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:  
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)  
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)  

### Installation  
1. Clone this repository:  

```bash 
  git clone https://github.com/Victor-Mannelli/GraphQL-Apollo-POC.git graphql-apollo-poc

  cd graphql-apollo-poc
```

2. Install dependencies for both the server and client:

```bash 
cd server
npm install

cd ../client
npm install
```

## â–¶ Running the Project
Start the GraphQL Server
To start the backend GraphQL API:

```bash 
node server/main.js
```
